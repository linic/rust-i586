# Certificates
For some reason I don't know yet, cargo doesn't seem to use the certificates that are in tinycore. The ca-certificates are installed, but it doesn't seem to use them.
Here is why I have the workaround documented below. While working on the workaround, I learned some things that I documented below.
Eventually, I would like to have cargo use the certificates already installed in tinycore and not rely on the workaround below.

## Cross Certification
I found it odd that openssl s_client and firefox do not give me the same root CA.

Here are the reasons:
- [a forum answer here](https://serverfault.com/questions/798991/ssl-certificates-certificate-chain-different-between-openssl-and-browsers)
- claud.ai answered with "A certificate can effectively be signed by two different CAs through the cross-certificate mechanism, though it's not quite the same as having two signatures on a single certificate.
What actually happens is:

Multiple valid paths: The certificate itself has one direct issuer, but cross-certificates create multiple valid certification paths that lead to different trusted roots.
Path options: When validating a certificate, software can find and verify different paths through the PKI hierarchy to reach a trusted root.

For example:

A website certificate might be issued by "Intermediate CA X"
This intermediate could have two valid parent certificates:

One signed by "Root CA A"
Another signed by "Root CA B" (via cross-signing)

This means clients could validate the website certificate through either root, depending on which roots they trust.
This approach is commonly used during root CA transitions. When introducing a new root CA, the new root might issue certificates for the same intermediates as the old root. This ensures that clients trusting either the old or new root can validate certificates issued by those intermediates during the transition period.
So while the certificate itself has just one direct issuer, cross-certificates create multiple valid trust paths, effectively giving the certificate multiple trust anchors."

## index.crates.io and crates.io
I could validate that [crates-io-chain.crt](./crates-io-chain.crt) taken with openssl s_client gives this root CA

which is the Amazon Root CA 1 as far as I can understand by reading 
[How to Prepare for AWSâ€™s Move to Its Own Certificate Authority](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-prepare-for-aws-move-to-its-own-certificate-authority/)
isolating the root CA in its own PEM/.crt file and running these commands:
``
openssl x509 -in amazon-root-ca1-via-openssl.crt -noout -pubkey | openssl asn1parse -noout -inform pem -out amazon-root-ca1-via-openssl.crt.key
openssl dgst -sha256 amazon-root-ca1-via-openssl.crt.key
```
which results in `fbe3018031f9586bcbf41727e417b7d1c45c2f47f93be372a17b96b50757d5a2`.
which matches the [Amazon Root CA 1 of the Amazon Trust Services page](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/).

I put in the certificates folder:
- [AmazonRootCA1.pem](./AmazonRootCA1.pem) which I took from [the Amazon Trust Services page](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/) 
- [amazon-root-ca1-via-openssl.crt](./amazon-root-ca1-via-openssl.crt) which I got from openssl s_client
- [amazon-root-ca1-via-firefox.crt](./amazon-root-ca1-via-firefox.crt) which I got from manually inspecting the certificate with firefox.
Using `diff -u -Z certificates/AmazonRootCA1.pem certificates/amazon-root-ca1-via-firefox.crt` certs are matching.
Using `diff -u -Z certificates/AmazonRootCA1.pem certificates/amazon-root-ca1-via-openssl.crt` certs are different.

Here's some more info:

In the page [How to Prepare for AWSâ€™s Move to Its Own Certificate Authority](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-prepare-for-aws-move-to-its-own-certificate-authority/)
it is written that "To maintain the ubiquity of the Amazon Trust Services CA, AWS purchased the Starfield Services CA, a root found in most browsers and which has been valid since 2005. This means you shouldnâ€™t have to take action to use the certificates issued by Amazon Trust Services"
so both should be valid and if I understand correctly, this is an example of cross-certification.

## static.crates.io
This uses the "GlobalSign Atlas R3 DV TLS CA Q4 2024" root CA which can be found on [Atlas TLS ICA Rotations](https://support.globalsign.com/atlas/atlas-tls/atlas-tls-ica-rotations)
On 2025-09-20, the certificate has now root CA "GlobalSign Atlas R3 DV TLS CA 2025 Q3". I put that one in the [static-crates-io-chain2.crt](./static-crates-io-chain2.crt) file. I'm using both `static-crates-io-chain.crt` which has the previous root CA and `static-crates-io-chain2.crt` which has the new root CA. I may rotate the certificates once a new root CA appears.
